# IoT-Based Health Monitoring System for Disabled People
This system uses on-body sensors to continuously monitor vital signs such as ECG, heart rate, temperature, and blood pressure. The collected data is transmitted wirelessly to a remote cloud server for real-time access and analysis by doctors. Unlike traditional ECG devices, it supports continuous and remote monitoring, enhancing early detection of cardiac issues. The system stores ECG signals in a database for later review or diagnosis. It leverages cloud computing for accessibility, allowing patients and physicians to access medical records remotely. This cable-free, real-time monitoring solution supports preventive healthcare and timely medical intervention.
